# TODO

Create different components for each part of the exhibition
This will allow for me to:

-   Keep image imports uncluttered
-   Modularize the website template
-   Borrow code for smooth auto snapping sections from portfolio
-   Have a React component for section that auto snaps
-   Figure out how to make image slider dynamic
-   Overhaul the intro screen to have the title/subtitle on left and
    the about content on the right
-   Move content/data into the respective Artwork components
