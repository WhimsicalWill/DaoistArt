# TODO

Create different components for each part of the exhibition
This will allow for me to:

-   Overhaul the intro screen to have the title/subtitle on left and
    the about content on the right
-   Format Artworks without flexbox when not needed
-   Dynamically decide whether to include arrows (only do so if more than 1 slide)
